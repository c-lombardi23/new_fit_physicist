    <h3>My Experience</h3>
    <p>
      During my incarceration, I was forced to adopt a different methodology for my workouts. The facility I was in did not have any weightlifting gear, despite common misconceptions, and also provided limited time and space for me to achieve any exercise. Because of this, I developed certain techniques that helped me to achieve maximum results in a fraction of the time. These workouts are also beneficial in that they can be performed anywhere, anytime due to the minimum gear required. Most of them only use a pull-up bar.

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>
      There are a few common exercises that I frequently use, and I will discuss them in detail here. Most of them you have hopefully seen before.

        <p>
          These have been a staple in my workout for years now. Not only do they burn an incredible amount of calories in a short time period, but they give you a full-body workout as well. To begin, start in a standing position with your feet shoulder-width apart. Reach down to the ground while bending your knees as though you are about to go into a pushup position. Next, throw your feet back so you are now in the pushup position and complete one pushup. Reverse the movement and jump back up into the standing position. This should be done ideally in one fluid movement. Of course, there are many variations, but we'll get into those in other articles.

      <div class="collapse" id="list-item-2">
        <p>
          Air squats are essential in any bodyweight circuit and can be used to perfect your squat form if you intend to transition into weighted squats. These are usually included in all my warm-ups and can be done daily. My personal preference is to perform these with my hands behind my head in what is called a 'prisoner squat' form to prevent any temptation to cheat by putting my hand on my knees. This position also allows me to be in a more upright position when squatting, which allows for more emphasis on the quads. With your hands clasped behind your head, start in a standing position with feet slightly outside shoulder width. Your toes should also be slightly pointed to the outside to allow you to get fully into the bottom position of the squat. The squat should begin with you breaking at the hips to start lowering yourself downward. Following this, break at the knees while slightly pushing your knees outward. Engage your core and make sure your lower back is not in an arched position to avoid the lower back taking over the movement. Once you are parallel to the ground, pause, and then reverse the movement back to the top. Repeat.

      <div class="collapse" id="list-item-3">
        <p>
          Most of you hopefully know what these are and have performed them before, but I will describe the motion for the sake of being thorough. Start in a standing position with your hands at your sides. Jump while spreading your feet wider than shoulder width while bringing your arms above your head so your hands touch. Your arms can be slightly bent, although I have seen people with straight arms before. Reverse the movement by jumping and bringing your hands back down to your sides and your feet back to the original standing position. I almost always include this exercise in my warm-up and cool-down sessions, mostly because they are low-impact and can be done in areas with little space.

      <a class="list-group-item list-group-item-action" href="#list-item-4" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#list-item-4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="list-item-4">Toe Touches</a>
      <div class="collapse" id="list-item-4">
        <p>
          Toe touches have also been a staple in my workout. They target the posterior chain and also provide a simple cardio workout. Start in a standing position with your feet together. Raise your hands together into the air and then reach down and touch your knees and then your toes while only slightly bending your knees. In fact, bend them as little as possible. Reach up and touch your knees again, and then reach your hands back up into the air while standing upright, back to the starting position.
